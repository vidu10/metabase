Metabase is a free and open-source application used for Business Intelligence and analytics. It is used for visualization, analysis of insights, creating and saving dashboards, and much more, helping in becoming an asset to businesses. Using Metabase is economical in the sense that the companies or businesses do not have to invest in expensive data science software or the data engineers or both. The main feature of Metabase is its user-friendly interface. Various business analytics operations can be performed using Metabase by anyone and get insights understandable by anyone.

Most businesses look for insights in their sales to compete with the market and make further decisions to upgrade or uplift their product or services. Suppose, our company needs to see the number of items sold last year. Keeping track of which, manually is tedious work. Thus, there are databases to help with these kinds of problems. Databases can keep a track of the sales and more to help the businesses. But databases are not in itself helpful unless we know how to query them. To query any database, there are languages such as Structured Query Language (SQL) that can help in getting insight into the business. This requires skilled people who know querying a database using such a language as SQL. Moreover, these languages cannot turn data into something more understandable like bar graphs, pie charts, etc. This is where Metabase comes into the picture. Metabase offers all these features without requiring any skill in query languages.

Metabase is used to connect to popular databases. The users with sound knowledge of query language like SQL can make a query using SQL with Metabase. It also has a user-friendly query builder that can be written in normal English language so that there is no need for the knowledge of SQL. Moreover, Metabase has a tremendous visualization library. It facilitates going from question to visualization, such as bar graphs, with just one click on a button.

### DIFFERENT USERS OF METABASE
Metabase is designed not only for data analysts but also for non-data scientists. There are four types of users of Metabase:
- **Admins**: Admins make sure about the installation and updating of the Metabase. They ensure that users are given login credentials, set necessary permissions, and connect Metabase to the required database.
- **Consumers**: Consumers are those who are more interested in insights from the data but would not create themselves. They may do some changes in the charts available but generally, do not produce them.
- **Analysts**: Analysts are those who have deep knowledge of metrics, databases, and statistics. They are the ones who create charts, insights, and metrics using Metabase.
- **Power Users**: Power users, as the name suggests, are a combination of Consumers and Analysts. They are the ones who have skills of admin, produce charts and metrics and create insights themselves.

### TYPE OF DATA ACCEPTED BY METABASE
Data comes in both structured and unstructured formats. Structured data is that which adheres to pre-defined data models like databases. Unstructured data can be in any format and is not in a defined data model such as webpages, images, videos, NoSQL databases, etc.

Metabase is a tool that readily connects to databases. So, if an organization uses SQL or NoSQL databases, Metabase is good to connect and work with.
If an organization stores its data in CSV reports, Metabase is suggested not to be good to use.

### QUERYING AND VISUALIZING IN METABASE
Metabase is a terrific tool that allows to connect to different databases and produce statistics of the data. Metabase allows querying in two different ways:
- **By Simple and Custom Questions**: Metabase has an extensive query builder which is easy to use and filter data. It has a Notebook editor too, which can help in querying data just like doing with the help of SQL. People not knowing SQL can copy and make use of it to create more questions. 
- **By Using Native Queries**: Metabase has something called native query editor which can be used to query data using some query language like SQL, and MongoDB.

When a question is raised, Metabase automatically identifies the most appropriate type of visualization for the result, but there are options available to select visualization type as required.
